# Genomic-and-transcriptomic-analysis-of-vertebrate-host-specific-_Lactobacillus-johnsonii_
The repository holds the code used to generate the comparative genomics data reported in the manuscript "Genomic and transcriptomic insights into vertebrate host-specific _Lactobacillus johnsonii_ adaptation in the gastrointestinal tract".
The key steps are: 
1. DNA selection
2. Average nucleotide analysis
3. Building a pangenome
4. Maximum likelihood tree analysis
5. Functional enrichment analysis ad rodent associated genes
